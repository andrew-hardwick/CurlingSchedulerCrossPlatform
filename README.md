# Curling Scheduler

Created and Maintained for Rocket City Curling Club (RC3) http://rocketcitycurlingclub.org

This application will schedule a single league/division of round robin play with configurable:

* Team Names
* Sheet Count
* Stones Count (Could be less than sheet count for some clubs)
* Draw Count per week
* Week Count
* Whether draws are balanced or squished. In the case of 6 games over 2 draws with 4 sheets, this would be the option between 3/3 and 4/2 draw balancing.
